# Image Gallery Replication Scripts 
I am working on a small prototype for replicating images from a sig gallery to a community gallery.


# Step 1 
./create_gallery.sh 
./replicate_definitions.sh 
./replicate_versions.sh 

Then you are done! This will take an existing gallery and move it all over to a new gallery so long as you are using the same subscription.
